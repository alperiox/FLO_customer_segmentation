# FLO RFM Analysis Project

This project was conducted to perform customer segmentation and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for FLO company.

## About the Project

In this project, RFM analysis was performed using FLO's customer data, and customers were divided into different groups. This analysis will help the company better understand customer behaviors and develop targeted marketing strategies.

## Features

- Calculation of RFM metrics
- Customer segmentation
- Data visualization
- Channel performance analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the project:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hakancelik/FLO_customer_segmentation.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file to perform RFM analysis:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Run the `visualizations.py` file to create visualizations:
   ```
   python visualizations.py
   ```

## Results

The analysis results and visualizations can be found in the `reports/media` folder. The generated graphs include:

- Channel performance
- RFM score distribution
- Segment distribution
- Correlation matrix
- Customer behavior analysis
- RFM segmentation results
